# Airline_analysis

This is also a Data analysis practice project and its goals are as follows:

- get familiar with the data provided,
- ask some questions and answer them by:
- make some visualization charts,
- making some statements,
- make a summary and or conclusions in order to:
- to be able to make a blog.

The sample is containing almost 130.000 flights including weekday, weekend, night, and day, normally priced ('coach price') - first-class priced flights as well. 
The investigation is about to find out whether is there any relationship between coach and first-class prices, or whether the prices are independent that someone 
flies at night or at the weekend or not. 

I use the normally used modules in Python such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, statsmodels.api.

I use some aggregate statistic numbers in order to get familiar with the data and ask some more questions and answer them.

Questions to be answered for instance as follows:
- Can we make a model which predict the first-class price if the coach price will increase?
- Growing coach prices mean growing first-class prices?
- Is it more expensive to fly at night or at the weekends?
- What type of delays are in the sample? Every delay is relevant? If not, how relevant delays look like?

These and sort of questions were asked and answered in the project. Hope every student can learn from that. Enjoy.
